# pi-hole-screen
A repository for my 128x64 OLED screen add-on for a Raspberry Pi based Pi-Hole systems.

# Current Status
This is a work in progress. The script is working but I need to update my blog post to explain how to implement it.

# Fonts
The follow fonts are used by the script to display data on the screen:
- big-shot.ttf (8px)
- Pixel12x10Mono-v1.1.0.ttf (16px)
- VCR_OSD_MONO_1.001.ttf (42px)
